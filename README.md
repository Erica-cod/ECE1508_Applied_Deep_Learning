## This project is based on the given topic:

### Question Answering: Task-Specific Models versus LLMs
Dataset: Recipe-MPR 

Description: The Recipe-MPR dataset consists of 500 queries by users, each having a set of answers given in five different ways. In this project, the students will train a deep model (suggested to be pretrained and only fine-tuned) on this dataset to answer questions.  The trained model is then to be compared against directly prompting an LLM. We know that beating LLMs is challenging, but obtaining a comparable performance is reasonable. The students are expected to train a model that perform above baseline accuracy which is roughly 65%.
